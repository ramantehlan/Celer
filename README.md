# Celer
Celer distributes processing across the devices connected to the Internet.

# About 
I created this project for **Startup weekend by Techstars** as an MVP. Celer utilizes the free processing power of devices connected to the internet and uses it for processing programs of business users. 

For MVP I used only mobile devices and created API for app developers to embed it in their app instead of ads, I also created two dashboards, one for business users and another one for API users.

- ***Business users dashboard***


- ***API users dashboard***
