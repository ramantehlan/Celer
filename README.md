# Celer
Celer distributes processing across the devices connected to the Internet.

# About 
I created this project for **Startup weekend by Techstars** as an MVP. Celer utilizes the free processing power of devices connected to the internet and uses it for processing programs of business users. 

For MVP I used only mobile devices and created API for app developers to embed it in their app instead of ads, I also created two dashboards, one for business users and another one for API users.

- **Business users dashboard**
     
     Business users can upload their program here and keep a track on the completed tasks. 

- **API users dashboard**
     
     App developers can check the strength of their network and check their revenue based on the processing power they provided through
      their user base.
      
- **API for APP developers** [*[Android API]*](https://github.com/ramantehlan/Celer-API)
     
     API to request the program from server to process and send output back to business users.

# Challenges for celer

- **Limited Power**
    A Device has only limited power and using a device for continues processing may damage or decrease its battery life.
 
- **Limited Network**
   Using the internet for continues processing might be a problem for limited data users and also a device is often connected 
   intermittently connected so achieving a constituency might be an issue here.
 
- **Platform**
    Different devices are running on different platforms or systems and they all have different hardware, libraries, framework or OS and
    change in any single layer might affect the processing network.
    
- **Permission**
    Device owner can't be completed into giving out their processing power even if it's not getting used.
