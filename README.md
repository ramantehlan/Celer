# Celer
Celer distributes processing across the devices connected to the Internet.

# About 
I created this project for **Startup weekend by Techstars** as an MVP. Celer utilizes the free processing power of devices connected to the internet and uses it for processing programs of business users. 

For MVP I used only mobile devices and created API for app developers to embed it in their app instead of ads, I also created two dashboards, one for business users and another one for API users.

- ***Business users dashboard***
     
     Business users can upload their program here and keep a track on the completed tasks. 

- ***API users dashboard***
     
     App developers can check the strength of their network and check their revenue based on the processing power they provided through
      their user base.
      
- ***API for APP developers*** [*[Android API]*](https://github.com/ramantehlan/Celer-API)
     
     API to request the program from server to process and send output back to business users.
